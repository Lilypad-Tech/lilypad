## Running jobs from smart contracts

We have deloyed the [LilypadOnChainJobCreator](../hardhat/contracts/LilypadOnChainJobCreator.sol) contract which you can use to trigger running jobs on the lilypad network from other smart contracts.

It works in tandem with the `lilypad jobcreator` on-chain which will watch the on-chain contract and manage jobs on behalf of contracts that submit them.

#### Creating a job

You will need to know the contract address for the on-chain job creator so we can submit transactions to it.

The production controller address is `0x8e136587e3e5266d5244f6aa896E5CAf8E969946` and you can ask it for the address of the on-chain job creator `getJobCreatorAddress()`

Running a job involves 2 phases:

 * calling `approve` on the ERC-20 contract to allow the solver to spend your tokens
 * trigger the job via the on chain job manager

Now we know the address of the on-chain job controller - we can ask it for 3 things:

 * the address of the ERC-20 token contract - `getTokenAddress()`
 * how much the required deposit it - `getRequiredDeposit()`
 * the address of the solver that will handle running the job for us - `getControllerAddress()`

Knowing these 3 things means we can call the standard ERC-20 `approve` to allow the solver to spend our tokens on our behalf.

Now - we can call the `runJob` method of the on chain controller from another contract.  This will cause the job-creator service to kick in and do the following things:

 * check that funds have been approved for the solver
 * transfer those funds to it's wallet
 * run the job on lilypad
 * call the `submitResults` method on the on-chain job creator
 * the on-chain job creator will call the `submitResults` of the original calling contract

The following is an example on-chain smart contract:

```solidity

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract ExampleClient is Ownable, Initializable, ILilypadJobClient {

  address private jobManagerAddress;
  ILilypadJobManager private jobManagerContract;

  mapping(uint256 => string) private jobResults;

  event JobCreated(
    uint256 id,
    string message
  );

  event JobCompleted(
    uint256 id,
    string dealId,
    string dataId
  );

  function initialize(address _jobManagerAddress) public initializer {
    setJobManagerAddress(_jobManagerAddress);
  }

  function setJobManagerAddress(address _jobManagerAddress) public onlyOwner {
    require(_jobManagerAddress != address(0), "Job manager address");
    jobManagerAddress = _jobManagerAddress;
    jobManagerContract = ILilypadJobManager(jobManagerAddress);
  }

  function getJobResult(uint256 _jobID) public view returns (string memory) {
    return jobResults[_jobID];
  }

  function runCowsay(
    string memory message
  ) public {
    string[] memory inputs = new string[](1);
    inputs[0] = string(abi.encodePacked("Message=", message));
    uint256 id = jobManagerContract.runJob(
      "cowsay:v0.0.3",
      inputs,
      msg.sender
    );

    emit JobCreated(
      id,
      message
    );
  }

  function submitResults(
    uint256 id,
    string memory dealId,
    string memory dataId
  ) public override {
    jobResults[id] = dataId;
    emit JobCompleted(
      id,
      dealId,
      dataId
    );
  }
}
```

Here is an example of a script that brings all of this together:

```typescript
import bluebird from 'bluebird'
import {
  connectToken,
  connectJobManager,
  connectExampleClient,
  getWallet,
  getAddress,
} from '../utils/web3'
import { ethers } from 'hardhat'

async function main() {
  // it's annoying to not be able to use argv but hardhat complains about it
  const message = process.env.MESSAGE || 'Hello World!'

  const token = await connectToken()
  const manager = await connectJobManager()
  const client = await connectExampleClient()

  const setRequiredDepositTx = await manager
    .connect(getWallet('solver'))
    .setRequiredDeposit(ethers.parseEther("2"))
  await setRequiredDepositTx.wait()

  const requiredDeposit = await manager.getRequiredDeposit()

  console.log(`requiredDeposit: ${Number(requiredDeposit)}`)

  const paytokensTx = await token
    .connect(getWallet('job_creator'))
    .approve(getAddress('solver'), requiredDeposit)
  await paytokensTx.wait()

  console.log(`tokens approved: ${paytokensTx.hash}`)

  const runjobTx = await client
    .connect(getWallet('job_creator'))
    .runCowsay(message)
  const receipt = await runjobTx.wait()
  if(!receipt) throw new Error(`no receipt`)

  console.log(`submitted job: ${runjobTx.hash}`)

  let jobID = 0

  receipt.logs.forEach(log => {
    const logs = client.interface.parseLog(log as any)
    if(!logs) return
    jobID = Number(logs.args[0])
  })

  console.log(`Job ID: ${jobID}`)
  console.log(`Waiting for job to be completed...`)

  let result = ''

  while(!result) {
    result = await client.getJobResult(jobID)
    if(!result) {
      await bluebird.delay(1000)
    }
  }

  console.log(`Job result: ${result}`)
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});

```
