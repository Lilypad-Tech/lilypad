# Development Setup

Before starting development, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- Docker
- Node.js
- Golang

## Installation

First, install the required Node.js modules and generate a local `.env` file containing private keys for various services. Run the following commands:

```bash
(cd hardhat && yarn install)
./stack print-env > .env
```

## Booting the Stack

### 1 - Bacalhau

To run a Bacalhau node on the same machine as the resource provider, follow these steps:

```bash
# Install the latest Bacalhau release which works with GPUs (https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/issues/2858)
wget https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/releases/download/v1.0.3/bacalhau_v1.0.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# Extract the downloaded archive and move the `bacalhau` binary to `/usr/local/bin`
tar xfv bacalhau_v1.0.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mv bacalhau /usr/local/bin
# Set the IPFS data path by exporting the `BACALHAU_SERVE_IPFS_PATH` variable to your desired location
export BACALHAU_SERVE_IPFS_PATH=/tmp/lilypad/data/ipfs
# Run Bacalhau as both a compute node and a requester node
bacalhau serve --node-type compute,requester --peer none --private-internal-ipfs=false --job-selection-accept-networked
```

### 2 - Lilypad

To initiate the boot sequence for Lilypad, run the following command:

```bash
./stack boot
```

This command performs the following four phases within the boot sequence:

#### 2.1 - Geth

During this phase, the following tasks are executed:

```bash
./stack geth
./stack fund-admin
./stack fund-services-ether
./stack balances
```

These commands start Geth, allocates eth to the admin, faucet, solver, mediator, resource_provider, job_creator, and directory accounts.

#### 2.2 - Compile Contracts

```bash
./stack compile-contracts
```

This compiles the smart contracts and generates Go bindings in `pkg/contract/bindings/contracts`.

#### 2.3 - Deploy Contracts

```bash
./stack deploy-contracts
```

This deploys the smart contracts. Note that services will not have any tokens at this point.

#### 2.4 - Fund Tokens

```bash
./stack fund-services-tokens
./stack balances
```
This funds the services with tokens and prints the balances.

### 3 - Run Services

Run the following commands in separate terminal windows:

```bash
./stack solver
```

Wait for the solver to start when `ðŸŸ¡ SOL solver registered` is logged, and then run:

```bash
./stack mediator
```

If you have a GPU, run the following command in a separate terminal window:

```bash
./stack resource-provider --offer-gpu 1
```

Otherwise, if you don't have a GPU:

```bash
./stack resource-provider
```

Run Cowsay:

```bash
./stack run cowsay:v0.0.1 -i Message="moo"
```

Run SDXL:

```bash
./stack runsdxl sdxl:v0.9-lilypad1 PROMPT="beautiful view of iceland with a record player"
```

### 4 - Run Cowsay On-Chain

Start the on-chain Job Creator:

```bash
./stack jobcreator
```

```bash
./stack run-cowsay-onchain
```

## Stopping the Stack

To stop Geth at any time, use the following command:

```bash
./stack geth-stop
```

To reset Geth data, effectively performing a complete restart, use the following command:

```bash
./stack clean
```

Please note that after running `clean`, you will need to re-run the `fund-admin` and `fund-services` commands.

## Unit Tests

Run the smart contract unit tests with the following command:

```bash
./stack unit-tests
```

## Regenerating Go Bindings

Whenever you make changes to the smart contracts, regenerate the Go bindings in `pkg/contract/bindings/contracts` by running:

```bash
./stack compile-contracts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Receive Buffer Size Error

`failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size` See https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Receive-Buffer-Size for details. Fix for Linux:
```
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2500000
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2500000
```
